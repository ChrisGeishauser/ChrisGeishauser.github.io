About Me
======
I am a PhD student in the [Dialogue Systems and Machine Learning group](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning.html) at Heinrich Heine University in DÃ¼sseldorf. My topic is about dialogue policy optimization where I use reinforcement learning with the goal to make dialog systems more adaptable, natural und quicker in learning.
