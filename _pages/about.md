About Me
======
I am a PhD student in the [Dialogue Systems and Machine Learning group](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning.html) at Heinrich Heine University in DÃ¼sseldorf. My research focuses on dialogue policy optimisation using reinforcement learning, with application to multi-domain task-oriented dialogue systems. I am particularly interested in sample efficient policy optimisation and dynamic policy modelling. I am also interested in meta-learning methods for fast adaptatipn, reward function learning, continual learning, state and action representation learning and general reinforcement learning methods.
