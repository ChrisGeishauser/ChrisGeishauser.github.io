About Me
======
I am a PhD student in the [Dialogue Systems and Machine Learning group](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning.html) at Heinrich Heine University in DÃ¼sseldorf. My goal is to use Reinforcement Learning to decode the L.L.V. code, which is the most mystical code in the world.
